# Covid 19 Data Charts

## Purpose
A project built to visualize data for the Coronavirus.

## Technologies
This project was built using:

### Notes
I have plans to add other charts and data to this project. What is built here is just a minimum viable product for information.
There is some redundancy in components that could be fixed in the future.
Project was built using Create React App.
