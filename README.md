# Covid 19 Data Charts

## Purpose

A project built to visualize data for the Coronavirus.

## Technologies

This project was built using:
React
Material UI
Recharts
Axios

### Notes

What I have built is mainly just a minimum viable product for Covid 19 information with only a few different charts. See bellow for the API I used for my data.

I had to remove my chart for US State data from the site. The API kept giving me errors and breaking the site. I left in the code for the states data to show how it worked when the API was not giving me errors.

Project was built using Create React App.
